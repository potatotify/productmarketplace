# NextGen Backend API

A RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL for managing products, categories, and user authentication.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT
- Role-based access control (User/Admin)
- CRUD operations for products and categories
- MySQL database with proper relationships
- Input validation and error handling
- Secure password hashing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MySQL (v8.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=nextgen_db
DB_PORT=3306

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=30d
```

3. **Set up the database (one-time only):**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   
   This will create the database, tables, and optionally insert sample data.
   
   > **Note:** The database setup only needs to be run once during initial project setup.
> After that, the database will be managed through normal user interactions.
> 
> ðŸ“– **For detailed database setup instructions, see [DATABASE-SETUP.md](./DATABASE-SETUP.md)**
